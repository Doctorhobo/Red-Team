// This class is used to read in and extract the desired data from the binary file.

// value for some range of in the file. It has the ability to extract double values
// as 32 or 64 bit, and as little endian or big endian.
// Requirements: This class helps satisfy all requirements related to interpreting
// data as binary or hex, interpreting values as 32 bit or 64 bit, and interpreting
// values as little endian or big endian
